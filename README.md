# memory_nightmare
Crash a friend PC by filling up his RAM !
You can compile-it by using the command : gcc -std=c2x '.\Memory nightmare.c' -omemory_nightmare
Then execute the executable (test with valgrind could be funny ðŸ˜…)
(c2x is needed because of nullptr, if you don't have it, you will need to add #define nullptr NULL)

-  Do anything you want with this, but please, make sure to not screw up your friend, make sure he saved his files. This program (kind of slowy but) surely will fill up the RAM (I don't know if it would work well on servers with terrabytes of RAM, could be fun to try but I don't have this kind of crazy hardware ðŸ¤£).

-  Also, credit me (Valentin582971). Even if it's easy to copy, to understand and to do the same thing, I didn't use anything online, all was done by me and myself only. I won't pursue you, it's open, but it would be nice.

Thanks, and have fun !
